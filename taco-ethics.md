# Taco ethics

Simple rules that will make our life easier:

1. Giving a :taco: should be fun.
2. Giving a :taco: should feel good.
3. Giving a :taco: should be honest.
4. Avoid :taco: for meeting attendance (especially for partners).
5. Avoid :taco: begging in private messages.
6. Better to give :taco: for external effects, not internal.

External effect — thing that will affect the world outside the team: blog post, product feature, presentation design and so on.

Internal effect — thing that will affect the team only: funny jokes, manage repos, writing this doc and so on.
